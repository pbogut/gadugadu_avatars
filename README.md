gadugadu_avatars
================

Plugin for Gajim to fetch GaduGadu Avatars of your GG friends.
You need to provide GG transport domain (ie. gg.uaznia.net) so plugin can recognize GG contacts and gets their Avatars.
Iam using 'roster-info' event, probably not the best choice, but couldn't find any better.

I wrote this plugin just to learn some Python and Gajim plugin system. Never used Python before :)

Plugin is on GPL license, choose your version, i don't care ;)
